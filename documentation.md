4. Functional Requirements
  FOR SURE:
    a. User Management
      - Register with Email & Password
      - Log-in & Log-Out
      - State the User Roles: Prospector*, Poster, Guest, Commenter (verify the various roles since these roles are interchangeable)
      - Edit Profile (simple)
      - Handle Authentication via Supabase Auth* (verify this via AI)
    b. Case Submission
      Definition: handles the intake of user-submitted problems through a dual-track system — an AI-assisted track for general users and a trusted track for verified communities. The goal is to capture natural human expression while maintaining data integrity for the problem matrix.
        b1. Freeform Case Input
          - System must provide a single free-form text input field for problem submission
          - System must not present structured form fields to the user
          - System must accept natural language input without formatting requirements
          - System must display a submission button below the text input
          - System must display a placeholder prompt — "Describe your problem in your own words..."
        b2. Dual Track Routing
          - System must determine submission track upon form submission
          - System must route general user submissions through the AI-assisted track
          - System must route verified community submissions through the trusted track
          - System must identify the user track based on the account verification status and community membership
        b3.  AI-Assisted Track
          - System must send raw submission to Gemini API for processing
          - AI must validate whether the submission is a genuine problem or noise
          - AI must extract and generate the following from raw input:

            Structured problem summary
            Category classification
            Inferred pain level
            Gap score
            Prospector CTA

          - System must store AI-generated output permanently in Supabase upon confirmation
          - System must never regenerate AI output after confirmation — response is persisted
        b4. Trusted Track
          - System must allow verified community members to bypass AI layer
          - System must post trusted submissions directly to matrix without AI processing
          - System must still subject trusted submissions to community validation

          - System must allow user to resubmit with additional context
          - System must not permanently block any user based on single rejection
        b6. Duplicate Detection
          - System must check submitted problem against existing matrix entries
          - AI must determine if submission is semantically similar to existing problem
          - System must notify user if duplicate is detected
          - System must display existing similar problem to user
          - System must allow user to confirm existing problem instead of creating duplicate
          - System must increment pain score of existing problem upon user confirmation
        b7. Community Validation

        b10. Reporting
          - System must display a report button on every problem card
          - System must allow any user to flag a problem as fake, harmful, or irrelevant
          - System must send flagged problems to admin review queue
          - System must hide problem from matrix upon reaching five reports
          - System must restore problem if admin clears the report
    c. AI Validation & Convergence
      - Send every submitted case to the Gemini API for validation
      - Determine if the case submission is a genuine problem/solution or noise
      - Check if submission is similar to existing problems; converge similar problems into one weighted entry
      - generate a structured problem statement from raw input
      - gap score based on problem & existing solutions
      - generate a call to action for prospectors
    d. Web Scraping

      - extract post titles, bodies as problems
      - extract top comments as solutions
      - run automatically at defined intervals via Vercel Cron Jobs
      - scraped data passes through AI validation before storage
    e. Case Matrix
      - display validated case on a two-axis matrix where the Y-axis is pain level, X-axis is solution existence
      - cases are dots sized by pain score
      - dots colored by status (Amber for problem, Grey for mixed, Patine Green for solved)

      - the purpose of the system components
      - list of features: submission of problems (telephone?), AI validation, matrix display, solution proposal
      - The system must flag the case on sensitivity (simple = low; complex = high)
      - The system must display a disclaimer on all legal and medical problem cards
      - AI must apply stricter validation on high-sensitivity domain submissions
      - It needs an external prospector for it to be validated
